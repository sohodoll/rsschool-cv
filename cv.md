## Briefly About Me

A BBA graduate (XAMK University, Mikkeli, Finland). I have done the Erasmus exchange to Universitat de Vic, studying audiovisual communications. I am a native Russian speaker, while my English is fluent (IELTS confirmed). I know the stylistics and grammar of both languages well.

I am a passionate writer. I have been doing content writing in English for 2,5 years, chiefly in the PropTech field of the London property market.

I also want to share my video editing and production skills. I am developing an English YT channel dedicated to running. Under my guidance, we have gained 7k subs in a single month with high-quality content (our average like to dislike ratio is 97%). One of our latest uploads gained 120k views in 1 month.

Currently, I am learning Front-End development.
